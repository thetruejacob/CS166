    "For the second part, consider a single vertex $v$. Each $v$ must ask each of its $d(v)$ friends how many friends they have, so each $v$ will obtain $d(v)$ lists. There are in total $\\sum_{v \\in V} d(v)$ lists. As for the total number of names on lists, consider that each $v$ has $d(v)$ friends, and each of the $d(v)$ friends will also have a record stating that $v$ has $d(v)$ friends. This is a list of length $d(v)$. So there are in total $d(v)^2$ names generated by $v$. Thus the average number of friends of friends is \n",
